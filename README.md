# Linux kernel with pf and ck patch-sets

This is the regular linux kernel based off the github mirror of the linux source. It contains the git formatted and applied patches of the [linux-pf](http://pfactum.github.io/pf-kernel/) project and the [linux-ck](http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/) project ([patch-sets located here](http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/4.0/4.14/4.14-ck1/patches/)). This was put together by me so that I could have a repository with these projects that I could call from, its not intended for others to use, however feel free to do so. There's no changes outside of those already listed besides Void Linux's patch, [commit here](https://github.com/Coding-Doctors/linux/commit/c1a6545cb21de0c890cb0ab77c74d8eaa3feb7c6).

## Future possibilities

In the future I may look to applying the zen patch-sets, but as of now I will forgo it as of kernel version 4.14, as I'll likely be applying it as the root patch-set ontop of the last kernel tag.
